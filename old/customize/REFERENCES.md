### **Add Chess Stuff**

Visit the [Chess.com API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) for more endpoints. Should you wish to use any of them, you'll have to take a look into [chessapi.js](../scripts/chessapi.js). I hope the documentation there is enough for you to add your own stuff!

### **Creating a Custom BlunderBot**

`BlunderBot` inherits from `Discord.Client` documented at [discord.io](https://izy521.gitbooks.io/discord-io/content/). If you're not familiar with [Web-Sockets](https://socket.io/docs/), I suggest looking through that documentation.

### **More Discord Commands**

For more control over the server, look through [Discord's API documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro). See [NAMESPACE.md](NAMESPACE.md) for how to make requests using `this._discordAPI` that I've already setup.
